    <h1>Love</h1>
    <p>Love is a beautiful thing.</p>
    <p>"Love is not about how many days, months, or years you have been together. It’s all about how much you love each other every single day."</p>
    <p>"You don’t love someone for their looks, or their clothes, or their fancy car, but because they sing a song only you can hear." </p>
